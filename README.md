# wsbfeels

Outputs the percentage of people commenting "call" or "put" on r/wallstreetbets. 

Collects (most) positions commented within 24 hours and saves it to a csv file to be parsed.

Todo:

-test if inverse wsb is profitable. Maybe even have a chart.
-scan submission titles as well
-improve accuracy
-get price of option at the time of creation, the see which plays were profitable and which one expired worthless
-detect sarcasm/stupidity

This is just for fun, not for profit. Just to collect and analyse data from r/wallstreetbets
