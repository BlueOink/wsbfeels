# wsbfeels

Outputs the percentage of people commenting "call" or "put" on r/wallstreetbets. 

Collects (most) positions commented within 24 hours and saves it to a csv file to be parsed.

Todo:

-add minutely, hourly, daily, and weekly trends for "call" and "put" data

-find an accurate way to make a stream of what plays people have.

-test if inverse wsb is profitable. Maybe even have a chart.

This is just for fun, not for profit. Just to collect and analyse data from r/wsb
